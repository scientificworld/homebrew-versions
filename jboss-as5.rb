      The home of JBoss Application Server 5 is:
      #{libexec}

      You may want to add the following to your .bash_profile:
        export JBOSS_HOME=#{libexec}
        export PATH=${PATH}:${JBOSS_HOME}/bin

      Note: The support scripts used by JBoss Application Server 5 have
      very generic names. These are likely to conflict with support scripts
      used by other Java-based server software. Hence they are *NOT* linked
      to bin.
